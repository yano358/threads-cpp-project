# Elevator Simulation Project

This project simulates an elevator system with multiple client entities using C++ and ncurses library for visualization.

## Project Structure

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function and the implementation of the elevator system.
- `Client.h` and `Client.cpp`: Define the `Client` class, which represents the entities that interact with the elevator.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the project.

## Building and Running the Project

To build the project, run the following command in the terminal:

`make`

## Usage
- Press the `Space` key to exit the simulation and end all threads.
- The elevator system will simulate clients arriving at random intervals and requesting elevator service.
